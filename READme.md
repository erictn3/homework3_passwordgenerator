![screenshot](../HW3/assets/images/screenshot.png "pwgeneratorscreenshot")

the purpose of this code is to create a code that allows users to receive a random password between 5 to 15 characters long

the code relies on the checked elements to see what type of variation the user would like to have in their random password

by using the charset we are to create functions for random lower-case character, random upper-case character, symbol, and number
